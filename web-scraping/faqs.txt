What are BINs?
Bank Identification Numbers (BINs) are fundamental to payments. They identify the issuing institution for each cardholder account and enable transactions to be properly routed. BINs are currently the first six digits of the account number.
Since the 1960s, Mastercard has been closely identified with the 51-55 BIN range.
Who governs BINs?
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), an independent, non-governmental international organization that develops voluntary global standards. The ISO/IEC 7812 standard defines an Issuer Identification Number (IIN), known as a BIN within the payments industry.
The American Bankers Association is the current registration authority that manages the BIN allocation process on behalf of ISO.
Why are we talking about BINs?
The payments industry is more complex than ever. With new devices and technologies emerging in a connected world, the industry's finite supply of BINs is reaching current capacities.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) which has published ISO/IEC 7812 to define BINs, and the American Bankers Association which is the registration authority managing the numbers, has a limited supply of unused or unallocated numbers. So, the industry needs more BINs to manage industry growth. 
What is Mastercard doing to alleviate the limited supply of BINs?
To expand supply, Mastercard is rolling out an additional 50,000 six-digit BINs (222100-272099). This will effectively double the existing supply of Mastercard BINs - allowing merchants to accept millions more transactions and our issuers to continue to support business growth.
The 2-series BINs adhere to the current (2015 revision) ISO industry standard and will work exactly the same way as the 5-series BINs do today.
When do changes go into effect?
Cards with 2-series BINs were first issued in 2017. 
How will the 2-series BINs impact issuers?
Issuers will need to upgrade their systems to be compatible with 2-series BINs, but all systems should be analyzed to determine if any additional changes are required. Software providers may have updates available, and internally developed solutions may require enhancements.
For more information, visit the 2-series BIN page.
How will the 2-series BINs impact service providers and vendors?
Acquirers will need to upgrade their systems to be compatible with 2-series BINs. 
For more information, visit the 2-series BIN page.
What other changes may impact BINs in the future?
The industry is considering a move to a new 8-digit BIN standard and is discussing an appropriate implementation date. If adopted, it would require more extensive systems planning and upgrades.
Mastercard is working with a committed group of industry participants to ensure all voices are heard in establishing the most efficient standard for continued industry growth. 
Whom can I contact at Mastercard with questions related to the 2-series BINs?
If you have a dedicated Mastercard representative, you may first contact that individual. Alternatively, you can send us an email.
How do I apply for a Mastercard?
Mastercard has created an online tool to help you find a card and assist in making decisions about which card products are available.

Depending on your destination, driving directions and a map may also be available.
Why can't I locate ATMs in a specific country?
If an ATM location or a specific country is not listed, then information is not available. Mastercard receives ATM location information from financial institutions and we continue to work with them to provide the most updated information.

What is the fee for withdrawing money or taking a cash advance from an ATM?
Mastercard does not determine ATM fees. Any fees charged by the ATM owner are disclosed at the time the transaction is initated and you're given the option to discontinue the transaction if you don't wish to pay the fees. It's also a good idea to check with the financial institution that issued your card to determine their ATM fee policies. You'll find their contact information on the back of your Mastercard and on your billing statement, or you can visit their website.

Can I use my prepaid card, gift card or credit card at an ATM?
Yes. You may withdraw cash against the balance on most Mastercard prepaid and gift cards at any ATM. However, not all prepaid and gift card issuers allow ATM or foreign transactions.

Can I pay my billers who accept Mastercard® directly from this site?
No. To pay a bill, please call your biller or visit their website.
Do I have to pay a fee for bill payment using a Mastercard?
Mastercard does not charge a fee for bill payment, though your service provider might charge a fee. Be sure to ask them about fees or any restrictions associated with making a payment using your Mastercard.
How do I pay a bill with a Mastercard?
Please contact your biller to make an electronic payment. Payment is often offered through their website or by phone.
How often can I make automatic bill payments, and when do bills get paid?
Automatic bill pay is an arrangement you make with your selected biller or service provider(s), so you'll need to contact them directly to arrange payments. Each biller has its own procedure for automatic bill payment.
Is there a limit to the number of automatic bill payments I can have on a Mastercard?
No, but you may be limited in making overall charges to your Mastercard account if doing so would cause you to exceed your credit limit.
Who issued my card?
Find your card issuer's contact information on the back of your Mastercard and on your billing statement.
Which cards can I use to pay bills?
You can use any credit or debit card with the Mastercard logo, though you should confirm with each biller that they accept this card as a form of payment.
What is automatic bill payment?
Automatic bill payment allows your selected service providers to automatically charge your Mastercard account on a regular basis. This can help you avoid late fees and charges.
What is manual bill payment?
Manual bill payment means you initiate the payment process yourself. This gives you the freedom to select the payment date and amount each time a bill is due.
If I enroll in automatic bill payment, will I continue to receive a bill?
Most billers continue to mail a paper bill, though some providers may offer an online bill or no bill at all. This can be determined when you set up your automatic bill payment plan.
What information will the service provider/biller request?
Bill pay is an arrangement you make with your selected service provider(s), so you will need to contact each provider directly to arrange payment amounts and scheduling.
Typically, you'll be asked for your Mastercard account number and expiration date, though you might also be asked for additional information. For automatic bill payment, you may also need to specify the payment amount and specific date you wish to be charged.
What if my Mastercard account information changes?
If your Mastercard account information changes due to a lost or stolen card, a new expiration date or an upgrade to a new product, be sure to provide each biller with the updated account information in order to prevent an interruption in service. We recommend you keep a list of billers that you pay automatically so you can efficiently update this information when necessary.
What if I want to stop an automatic bill payment?
Contact your biller directly and follow their procedures to cancel or change the method of payment.
What if I don't agree with a payment amount made on my Mastercard statement?
We recommend that you review your paper or electronic bill prior to any payment being made with your Mastercard. However, if there is an error or question about a payment billed to your card, contact your biller immediately to resolve any discrepancies.
As a Mastercard cardholder, you are not responsible for unauthorized purchases charged to your account. Learn more about our Zero Liability Protection. Exceptions apply.
What are the benefits of bill payment using a Mastercard?
Using your Mastercard is much faster and more convenient than writing checks. You can initiate payments at any time and from anywhere in the world. Charges will appear on your monthly statement, so it's an easy and efficient way to stay organized and keep track of your expenses. In addition, if you use automatic bill payment you won't have to worry about missed payments or late fees. Depending on the card you use, you may also be eligible to earn rewards.

What is cash with purchase?
Cash with purchase is a service offered by select retailers that allows consumers to get cash from their debit card when making a purchase.
Do I need to use my debit card to get cash back?
Yes, since the funds are drawn from an account linked to your debit card.
Is there a fee for this service?
Although the majority of retailers do not charge for this service, there are some locations that charge a fee.
What's the advantage of getting cash at purchase?
Cash with purchase is a convenient way to quickly and easily get cash from your account while shopping at your favorite retail locations, without having to go to an ATM. Plus, in most cases, there's no fee for this service, whereas you may be charged a fee at the ATM.
What's the maximum amount of cash I can get with my purchase?
The amount of cash you can get may vary by merchant and be subject to availability of funds at the time of purchase. If you have questions about the availability of funds at a particular merchant, please contact the merchant directly. The amount you can take out is also subject to the availability of funds in the account linked to your debit card.
What's a chip card?
A chip card is like a traditional magnetic stripe card, but it has an embedded microchip which encrypts your information, making it extremely difficult for the card to be copied or counterfeited.
Rather than swiping your chip card, you insert the chip end into the terminal to complete the transaction. Your card may also have contactless capabilities, so you can simply tap it at checkout when given the option.
Your chip card will also have a magnetic stripe on the back, so it's usable with any merchant, even if they haven't yet transitioned to new, chip-enabled terminals.
Are chip cards new?
Chip cards are relatively new in the US, though they have been in use elsewhere around the world for many years.
What are the benefits of the chip?
The embedded microchip provides robust security features and other capabilities that are not possible with traditional magnetic stripe cards. A chip card is virtually impossible to counterfeit.
Where can I use my chip card?
Use your chip card anywhere you use your magnetic stripe card. Insert it into terminals that are chip-enabled or swipe it the old fashioned way. You can also use your chip card for online payments, telephone payments and at ATMs, just like a traditional magnetic stripe card.
Whom do I contact if I want more information?
For more information about your chip card, please contact the financial institution that issued your Mastercard®. See the back of your Mastercard or your billing statement for their contact information.
Why is my card being upgraded to a chip card?
Your new chip card provides added security. Chip cards are being introduced in the US after much success in other parts of the world.
What's my PIN?
If you forgot your PIN or want to change it, please contact the financial institution that issued your Mastercard. See the back of your Mastercard or your billing statement for your issuer's contact information.
How does the chip work?
The chip communicates with the terminal to determine whether the card is authentic. If using a chip and pin debit card in the U.S, you'll be asked for your PIN at the time of transaction. If using a chip and pin credit card, no PIN will be required.
How do I know if my chip card has Mastercard contactless?
Cards that have contactless capabilities will have the word "contactless" and may also have a contactless symbol on the card. You can tap to pay at merchants that have the following symbol or contactless on the terminal:
If a merchant doesn't have this capability, you'll need to insert your chip card into the terminal.
What is a co-brand card program?
A co-brand card program is a partnership between Mastercard®, a Mastercard-issuing financial institution and a suitable partner company wishing to grow its business by offering added value. The co-branded card program is then marketed to that partner company's customer base.
What kinds of businesses have successful co-brand programs?
Many different industries have successfully implemented co-brand programs, including airlines, gasoline providers, automotive companies, warehouse clubs and supermarkets. One thing these companies have in common is a growing base of customers who purchase products or services on a recurring basis.
Who is responsible for promoting a co-brand card?
The level of support provided and the degree of responsibility for designing and implementing the solicitations and card promotions will depend on the agreement reached between the partner and the card issuer. Mastercard has many different levels of support and expertise available to help a company market its co-brand card and grow its business.
What does a Mastercard co-brand card look like?
Co-brand cards carry the Mastercard logo and must conform to certain Mastercard design standards. Mastercard rules permit the partner's logo to be a dominant feature on the face of the card. The name of the Mastercard issuing financial institution may appear, but it is not required. This and other card design details will be determined by the partner and the card issuer.
How do I find an issuer for a co-brand alliance?
The first place to begin is with a bank or financial institution with which your company already has a relationship. Or, Mastercard can provide a list of potential financial institutions from among the thousands we have done business with over the years.
What role does Mastercard play in developing a co-brand program?
That depends on the goals and budget of the partner company. However, Mastercard has a dedicated staff of highly experienced co-brand specialists who can help a company evaluate and establish a co-brand partnership that will meet the objectives of all parties involved.
What is Mastercard® contactless?
Mastercard contactless is like having exact change wherever you go. A simple tap of your card, key fob or smart phone is all it takes to pay at checkout.
Why should I use contactless?
There are many benefits to contactless payments:
Where can I make contactless payments?
Simply tap to pay anywhere you see the contactless symbol at checkout.  This includes fast food restaurants, gas stations, convenience stores, pharmacies, stadiums and more.
Find participating locations
If you don't see the contactless symbol, your contactless-enabled card can still be used by inserting your chip or swiping at checkout.
How do I pay with Mastercard contactless?
To make a purchase, simply tap your Mastercard contactless card, key fob or smart phone on the payment reader when checking out at participating retail locations.
Find participating locations
Can I use my contactless card or device on payment readers that don't display the contactless logo?
You can make contactless payments on any contactless payment reader that displays this symbol . You may also use contactless cards in magnetic stripe readers by swiping the card. However, you cannot use a contacless key fob or smart phone in a magnetic stripe reader.
How close does the "tap" have to be to the checkout reader?
Typically, when you tap your card/device at checkout, it must be within an inch or two of the contactless symbol on the terminal at the counter. Please note that if you have more than one contactless card in your wallet, you should remove the specific card you would like to use rather than tapping your wallet against the reader.
How will purchases appear on my monthly statement?
Purchases made with contactless will be displayed on your Mastercard statement just like any other purchase.
How does contactless work?
Contactless uses a hidden, embedded computer chip and radio frequency antennae. After you tap your contactless card or device at checkout, payment details are sent wirelessly to the Mastercard network. If using a mobile phone, moments after you tap, you'll receive payment confirmation and be on your way.
What is a key fob or payment tag?
A key fob or payment tag is a special contactless device that you can attach to your key chain. Card issuers sometimes provide this as a companion to your traditional primary Mastercard plastic card.
Do I have to treat my Mastercard contactless card or device in any special way?
Treat your contactless card or device as you would any other credit, debit or prepaid card. Always know where your contactless card or device is and keep it in a safe place. And be sure to keep a record of all of your card numbers, expiration dates and emergency phone numbers.
Is there a battery?
No, there is no battery.
Do I need to turn it on/off?
If you have a contactless-enabled mobile phone, you can turn it on or off. If you are using a contactless card or fob, it's always on and ready to use.
Is contactless secure?
Yes. Contactless payments provide secure encryption technology and Zero Liability Protection and are as secure as your regular card.
What do I do if my contactless card or device has been lost or stolen?
If you've lost your card or you suspect unauthorized activity on your account, immediately contact the financial institution that issued your card. If you don't know your card issuer's number, contact Mastercard and we will assist you in finding that information.

Where's the best place to get foreign currency?
The best place to get foreign currency is usually at your destination, not at home. At home, financial institutions have paid for transporting, securing and storing that foreign currency–– and those costs are passed on to you.
How much money should I exchange before I leave?
Only exchange enough money at home to pay for cabs, snacks and tips upon arrival.
ATMs are conveniently located at most airports and at major tourist destinations, as well as many other places. Use your bank’s ATM Finder app or the Mastercard® ATM Locator to find Mastercard ATMs online. You can also download the Mastercard Nearby app.
Where should I get foreign currency while I'm abroad?
Go to an ATM to get foreign currency at your destination, not an exchange bureau. The ATM may impose fees, but the exchange rate will be much more favorable than that of a currency exchange, so you'll save money overall.
Should I use a credit card to withdraw currency from an ATM while abroad?
Use a credit card to withdraw currency from a foreign ATM only if it’s your only option. Using a credit card at an ATM is considered a cash advance, which means:
Should I convert transactions into my home currency?
Merchants and ATM operators may offer to immediately convert the foreign price to your local currency, giving you a better idea of how much money you’re about to spend.
Although this seems like a good way to manage spending, it comes at a cost and incurs additional currency conversion fees (sometimes as much as 7%) to the transaction.
The best practice is to let the currency conversion be done by your home bank and decline the currency conversion option.
Should I tell my bank I'll be traveling abroad?
Yes, be sure to tell your bank you'll be traveling cross-border and where you're going. Your bank might decline a transaction for your protection unless they know the card's been authorized for use in countries other than your home country.
Many issuers allow you to register travel plans online in lieu of calling – check your issuer’s website.
What is the GDPR?
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a set of legal requirements for companies concerned with collecting, processing and protecting personal data. It was adopted in the EU in Spring 2016 and entered into force as of May 25, 2018. Learn more about the GDPR here. 
How can I apply for a Mastercard®?

If you already have a deposit account with a bank or credit union, they might be able to provide you with a Mastercard. Otherwise, Mastercard has created an online tool to help US-based consumers choose from available card products. 
How do we begin accepting Mastercard?
It's easy to get started. The first step is to contact an acquirer or a payment services provider to apply for a merchant account with a bank or one of its agents. 
How can I download the Mastercard brand mark for use on our website?
Electronic versions of the Mastercard brand mark are available for download from the Mastercard Brand Center.
How do we start accepting card and digital payments?
Learn here about accepting electronic payments.
What's an acquirer and why do we need one?
Also referred to as a merchant bank, an acquirer is a financial institution licensed by Mastercard to help a merchant accept Mastercard payments. Acquirers either sell their processing services directly to merchants or hire agents to sell on their behalf. These agents must be registered with Mastercard and clearly identify the Mastercard issuing bank they represent on their business cards and stationery. The merchant agreement should also clearly identify the name of the bank.
What's the difference between an acquirer and a payment facilitator?
A payment facilitator is a merchant of record who facilitates transactions on behalf of a sub-merchant. An acquirer is the bank or financial institution that processes credit and/or debit payments for a merchant.
What's an interchange rate?
Interchange rates are fees paid by acquirers to card issuers on purchase transactions conducted on payment cards. They are only one of many cost components included in a Merchant Discount Rate. Mastercard establishes its interchange rates, which are a necessary and efficient method by which Mastercard maintains a vibrant payments network.
Learn more about Mastercard interchange rates.
Will I incur any cost to accept payments?
Your acquirer/payment facilitator will provide you with information about costs.

What liability do I have for unauthorized purchases made on a lost or stolen Mastercard?
If you have Mastercard Zero Liability Protection, once you report your card to Mastercard as lost or stolen, no unauthorized charges should be posted to your account.

Q: What is Mastercard Send?
A: Mastercard Send is a first-of-its-kind interoperable global platform that enables funds to be sent quickly and securely via three payment flows:
Q: Which Mastercard Send flows are currently available in the U.S.?
A: The Mastercard Send API is available for Domestic P2P and Disbursements providers. Additionally, there is a Remittance API that can be used for providers looking to enable cross-border payments originating in the United States.
Q: Why is Mastercard offering these services?
A: In the U.S., Disbursements and P2P payments make up $4 trillion per year; most of these payments are made via checks, ACH transfers and cash. Currently, the methods for these payments are slow, lack ubiquity and create security concerns. Consumers want to be able to send and receive money using their connected devices regardless of where they bank and disbursers are looking for cheaper and more efficient ways to send money to their consumers. In line with Mastercard's vision to build a World Beyond Cash, Mastercard Send aims to make payments easier, safer and more efficient for all parties.
Q: How does a Send transaction work?
A: While most electronic P2P and Disbursements' solutions rely on slow, batch-oriented ACH methods, the Mastercard Send solution leverages debit networks to move funds, typically within seconds. Mastercard Send is unique: funds can be transferred to virtually all debit cards in the U.S. and, in most cases, funds can be transferred typically within seconds. Through a set of APIs, a service provider can request a transfer through a sending acquirer, which Mastercard then routes to any U.S. bank account via a debit card regardless of the brand.
Q: What cards are eligible for Mastercard Send transactions?
A: Currently, the service is only available for U.S. consumer debit and reloadable prepaid cards. However, the MoneySend mandate includes all consumer cards: debit, credit and prepaid. Mastercard recommends that issuers support all cards when migrating to Transaction Code 28 to prepare for future service enhancements.
Q: What role does an issuer play in a Send transaction?
A: One role that issuers play in a Send transaction is as receiving institutions. In this role, issuers are required to post funds to their cardholders' accounts.
When a service provider sends funds to a debit account using Transaction Code 28, the issuer of the receiver's debit card is paid a share of network fees. Once an issuer has complied with the MoneySend mandate to enable Transaction Code 28, they will be eligible to start collecting these fees. For more information on the mandate, see Global Operations Bulletin No. 2 (February 2, 2014).
Q: Can an issuer use Mastercard Send for a P2P program?
A: An issuer could offer P2P payment services by leveraging the Mastercard Send API to allow their cardholders to send and receive payments with their friends and family. While Mastercard Send is a critical part of a P2P program, interested issuers should consider the other necessary implementation measures and development requirements. These considerations should include: customer acquisition costs, receiver management requirements for users without accounts at a bank, the necessary user interfaces for a standalone or integrated mobile application, among other considerations.
Q: How does Mastercard Send differ from MoneySend?
A: Mastercard Send is the first-of-its-kind interoperable global platform that enables funds to be sent quickly and securely. In the U.S., it will enable disbursements and P2P payments to and from nearly any U.S. debit card account, including non-Mastercard debit cards. MoneySend is the Mastercard transaction type (Transaction Code 28) designed for real-time money transfers by issuers connected to the Mastercard network.

What data does Mastercard collect and how does Mastercard use it?

When processing a purchase transaction, we collect limited information such as card number, merchant name, location, and the date and amount of the transaction. Importantly, we do not generally collect the cardholder’s name, address or other directly identifiable information. We may collect additional personal information in other contexts, such as for fraud monitoring and prevention, authentication, risk management and dispute resolution, or when individuals decide to participate in one of our optional programs such as Priceless Cities.
How does Mastercard capture the value of data while protecting people’s privacy?
We help businesses, governments, the public sector and individuals better understand the world around them. To achieve this, we remove personal information by anonymizing data and produce aggregated trends and insights. One way that we use these trends and insights is for social good, thereby advancing financial inclusion and humanitarian efforts around the globe. Combined with our strong commitment to data ethics, this contributes to effective outcomes while respecting people’s privacy and human rights.
How can individuals know more about what data Mastercard collects and how that information may be used?
Transparency is core to Mastercard. We explain how we handle individuals’ personal information in our Global Privacy Notice, which is complemented by specific privacy notices for certain products and services. As a service provider, we refer individuals to the privacy notice provided by those third parties for more information on how their personal information is handled.
Does Mastercard share transaction data?
We do not share transaction data without consent or as otherwise legally permitted such as in the context of fraud prevention.
Does Mastercard comply with the GDPR?
Yes, in fact we’ve embraced the change as an opportunity to examine our data practices – ultimately deciding to go further and implement key consumer protections from the GDPR to our individual users around the globe. For instance, we will soon make our online portal available globally, so that individuals everywhere will be able to access, correct, modify or move their personal information. Find out about our approach to GDPR compliance in the EU GDPR FAQ page.
Has Mastercard received recognition for its privacy practices?
Yes. In Europe, our Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) have been approved by EEA Data Protection Authorities and allow us to transfer personal information from our cardholders, customers, partners and employees to all Mastercard entities globally.  In 2019, Mastercard also received certifications under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules system and the Privacy Recognition for Processors system.  For more information on the APEC systems, please visit: http://cbprs.org.
What steps does Mastercard take to ensure privacy is protected?
We take your privacy very seriously. That's why we embed privacy safeguards into all of our products and services, limiting data use to only what’s necessary and looking for ways to encrypt or de-identify personal information while making sure each product is still convenient and easy to use. In addition, we employ rigorous standards to ensure the safety and security of data not only within Mastercard, but with all our partners and vendors as well.
Who owns personal information?
Your personal information belongs to you; you control how it is used.
How can individuals control how their data is being used?
We provide individuals with privacy rights and choices. You can opt out of your personal information being used for marketing, data analytics and web analytics at any time and at no cost, using our online forms. Individuals also have the right to access, correct, modify or move their personal information via our online portal, which is currently available for all users located in the European Union and will shortly be accessible worldwide.
A merchant required me to make a minimum purchase when I used my credit card. What should I do?
A merchant located in the United States or a U.S. region/territory may set a minimum transaction amount for credit cards only. The amount may not exceed $10 and cannot discriminate between issuers or between Mastercard(r) and other acceptance brands. Merchants are not permitted to require a Mastercard cardholder to pay a minimum amount for a Debit Mastercard or Mastercard prepaid card transaction. If you believe that a merchant inappropriately requested a minimum charge, you may report this by completing a form available through this link: Report a problem.
A merchant wanted to charge a surcharge or fee to use my Mastercard. What should I do?
As a result of a court-approved settlement, Mastercard agreed to modify its rules to permit U.S. merchants to surcharge Mastercard credit cards as long as they complied with certain limitations.
Merchants have the option to add a surcharge at the "brand level" where the surcharge is the same for all Mastercard credit cards, regardless of the card's issuer, or they can add a surcharge at the "product level" (e.g., apply a surcharge to all World Mastercard cards regardless of the card's issuer but not standard Mastercard credit cards). Read the details on our merchant surcharge page. A merchant's ability to surcharge on credit cards is subject to any restrictions or prohibitions imposed by applicable state law. Mastercard rules continue to prohibit merchants from applying a surcharge on debit cards.
If you are not certain whether you have been charged appropriately, or you would like to report a questionable charge, send us an email and provide the information requested.
What should I do if the merchant surcharge was not clearly disclosed before I paid?
Merchants must clearly disclose their surcharges at the register and clearly indicate the amount of the surcharge on the receipt. If you believe you've been charged incorrectly, send us an email with the merchant details and other necessary information.
What should I do if the merchant surcharge was higher than I expected?
The surcharge that the merchant assesses may not exceed the merchant discount rate that the merchant pays for the credit card that is surcharged. In the United States, this charge for Mastercard typically ranges from 1.5% to 3% and in no event may the merchant surcharge greater than 4%. Merchants much clearly disclose their surcharges at the register and clearly indicate the amount of the surcharge on the receipt. If you do not believe that you have been charged appropriately, or you would like to report a questionable charge, send us an email.
Why was I charged a higher amount at the pump because I used my Mastercard?
A merchant may provide a discount to its customers paying cash, provided that the discount is posted. If you'd like to report a questionable charge, you may report a problem by completing this online form. 
Are merchants allowed to ask me to provide identification to use my Mastercard?
There are certain situations, such as shipping purposes, in which a merchant may require personal information. However, if you believe a merchant has violated the above standard or their actions requesting identification are questionable, you may report a problem by completing this online form. 
My card was declined while trying to make a purchase. What should I do?
If a transaction is declined, please contact the financial institution that issued your card. Sometimes banks put security measures in place on certain types of transactions to reduce the risk of fraud, which may result in declined transactions.

Are there alternative ways to validate PCI compliance to Mastercard if I use secure technology such as EMV or P2PE?
Mastercard offers a merchant implementing secure technologies such as EMV or P2PE alternative ways to validate their PCI DSS compliance. A qualifying merchant may validate compliance through either the Mastercard risk-based approach, (applies to eligible non-U.S. merchants only), or the Mastercard PCI Compliance Validation Exemption Program (the “Exemption Program”), (applies to eligible merchants in all regions).
Both the risk-based approach and PCI Compliance Validation Exemption Program provide some validation/reporting relief to merchants. Mastercard encourages you to review 10.3.4.1 risk-based approach and 10.3.4.2 PCI Compliance Validation Exemption Program in the Security Rules and Procedures Manual – Merchant Edition for more information on eligibility requirements. A merchant that does not satisfy all eligibility criteria must continue to validate its PCI DSS compliance in accordance with the SDP Program’s 10.3.4 Implementation Schedule.

The applicability of the PCI PA-DSS to third party-provided payment applications is defined in the PCI PA-DSS Program Guide found in the Document Library at  www.pcisecuritystandards.org. Mastercard also recommends that merchants use a Qualified Integrator & Reseller (QIR) listed on the PCI SSC website to implement a PCI PA-DSS-compliant payment application.
Where can I find PCI compliance validation tools, for example, Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs), Attestation of Compliance (AOCs) and the Prioritized Approach tool?

What is tokenization?
Tokenization is the process of replacing a card’s primary account number (PAN)—the 16-digit number on the plastic card—with a unique alternate card number, or “token.” Tokens can be used for mobile point-of-sale transactions, in-app purchases or online purchases.
What are the benefits of tokenization?
Tokenization reduces fraud related to digital payments by making transactions more secure by including a dynamic component with each transaction. It takes the security of a physical EMV chip and applies it to non-card environments including proximity, mobile and internet payments.
Merchants benefit from more secure transactions as well as faster checkout experiences, new payment acceptance options and more ways to sell.
How do I ensure that I can accept transactions from eligible devices?
Existing contactless terminals are compatible with tokenized transactions and no action is required. Mastercard® offers merchants a free, optional service for a more secure in-app payment acceptance called Digital Secure Remote Payment (DSRP). To use DSRP merchants must:
What is Mastercard’s role in the launch of digital wallets?
The new digital wallets connect into Mastercard Digital Enablement Service (MDES), so participating issuers can enable secure mobile payments on millions of devices.
What do these new digital payments mean for me?
For consumers and merchants alike, every purchase made with a tokenized Mastercard debit, credit, prepaid or small business card using Apple PayTM, Google PayTM or Samsung Pay in the United States offers the enhanced security and benefits of a digital Mastercard transaction including secure tokenization technology.
Will this affect the way I identify new or returning consumers?
Merchants that use card numbers to identify customers will not be able to recognize returning customers if it's the first time they're using their token, since it appears as a new card number. However, when used again, merchants will be able to recognize the token associated with that consumer’s device.
