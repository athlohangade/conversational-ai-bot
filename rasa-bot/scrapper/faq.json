Consumers want to be able to send and receive money using their connected devices regardless of where they bank and disbursers are looking for cheaper and more efficient ways to send money to their consumers.

Mastercard Send is unique: funds can be transferred to virtually all debit cards in the U.S. and, in most cases, funds can be transferred typically within seconds. Through a set of APIs, a service provider can request a transfer through a sending acquirer, which Mastercard then routes to any U.S. bank account via a debit card regardless of the brand."
