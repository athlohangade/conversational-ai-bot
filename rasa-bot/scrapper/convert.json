Your bank may or may not use Mastercard foreign exchange rates to bill you and may impose additional fees in connection with foreign currency transactions. Foreign exchange rates are specific to the date and time Mastercard processes the transaction which may be different from the transaction date. If your transaction is converted by the merchant or ATM operator, Mastercard foreign exchange rates will not apply. This will usually occur when you select to pay in your card's currency as opposed to the currency of the merchant or ATM."
